Section 4: Population Scale Analysis 
One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are
interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So, you processed
about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find
whether there is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on
ORMDL3 expression.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("expression_value.txt")
head(expr)
summary(expr)
```

Caculate the avgerage expression level of A/A. 
Extract the A/A rows 
```{r}
inds <- expr$geno == "A/A"
expr[inds,]
```

```{r}
inds <- expr$geno == "A/A"
summary(expr[inds,]$expr)
mean(expr[inds,]$exp)
```

Calculate teh average expression level of G/G
```{r}
inds <- expr$geno == "G/G"
summary(expr[inds,]$expr)
mean(expr[inds,]$exp)
```

```{r}
boxplot( exp~geno , data=expr, notch = TRUE)
```
